# GeoSay: Accurate Building Detection in VHR Remote Sensing Images Using Geometric Saliency

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPLv3-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

GeoSay is a building detection algorithm which produce geometric building index (GBI) for a remote sensing image. 

## Requirements

Building and using require the following libraries and programs

- OpenCV (2.4.13 is recommanded)
- [ASJDetector](https://github.com/cherubicXN/anisotropic-scale-junction-detector)
- CMake (at least 2.6)

## Usage

Windows:
```
GeoSay.exe ASJ_PATH ../images/test.png
```
